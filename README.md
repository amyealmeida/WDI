## Unit Breakdown

| Unit   | Title                           | Lessons Provided / Number of Sessions | Number of Flex Session | Holidays |
| ---    | ---                             |  ---                                  | --- |                  | --- |

| Unit 3 | ______________________________  |  ____________                         | _______ |              | --- |

> Note: Flex sessions are provided as buffers for content review or additional topics that instructors may want to cover; holidays are immersive-specific and because each immersive course typically has two national holidays that fall within the course timeline, we point out where we accounted for those holidays - feel free to move those free days as needed for your particular cohort.

Most of the materials in this folder are referenced in our baseline course plan on [Trello](insert-your-trello-link). Take a look.  Lessons, labs, and other resources are organized by Standard in the appropriate subfolders.

Tips for browsing the links below:

- The resources are linked to their location: clicking the link will take you to the lesson/lab readme, any starter/solution code, and tests.
- **+** - Resource links with a "+" are suggested topics for that time block and do not have an existing baseline resource. We'd love for you to contribute a resource with a pull request.
- **#** - Resource links with a "#" are time blocks dedicated for outcomes lessons. Coordinate with your local outcomes teams to fill these slots.
- **@** - Resource links with a "@" are resources from other courses that need to be adapted for COURSE-ACRONYM or resources that only contain learning objectives. We'd love for you to contribute a resource with a pull request.
- ***** - Resource links with a "*" are resources that are currently being worked on


This baseline scope and sequence of the curriculum is based on the following:

  - A 9am-5pm day with a lunch break from 1-2pm:

    - 9-10am represents a one hour session typically occupied by an exercise, introduction, reflection, and sometimes, a short lesson
    - 10am-1pm and 2-5pm are dedicated to lessons, labs, and outcomes sessions
    - Two holidays taken on *week 2, day 5* and *week 6, day 5*

---

## Unit 1

In this unit, students will be practicing the basics of _____________, how to _____________, and foundational ______________ concepts in _____________________ that we'll use for the entire rest of the course.

As it stands now, pre-work consists of _____________________________ that reinforce ___________________ fundamentals for ________________, so in this unit, we review _________________, _______________, and other foundational concepts in ________________.

Another goal of this unit is also to get students comfortable creating and manipulating __________, ___________, and _______________ as well as ________________ and _______________________.

##### Project 1

Student will be building their very first ______________________.

This project will be split into two phases. First, students will be creating _____________________________________. Then, they will be ________________________________________ as well as describing what happens when ___________________________________. Students will receive instructor feedback after each iteration.  Second, you will be coding the app itself. Students will implement the design they created in the first step using all of the knowledge gained during weeks one and two.

- **Goal**: _______________________________
- **Project Time**: ___ days
- **[Detailed Spec File](../projects/project-01/readme.md)**

---

## Unit 2


Now that students have had practice in _____________, ________________________, and the basics of ________________________, we'll get students to think more about __________________________ and practicing with ___________, _____________, and ________________.  Ultimately, students will learn to ________________________and use that __________________________________.

Students will have time to ________________________, ___________________________________, _________________________, and ___________________.  

Coupled with the early lessons/labs on __________________, student work should start to really take shape as this unit ends with a week focused on ______________, _______________, and ____________________________.

Students have already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but this time, students will be challenged to work on a whole project with a small team.  Instructors will partner students with other classmates, and students will use research provided by partner companies and architect, design, and collaboratively build an app of their own design.

This project is meant to push students both technically and collaboratively.

- **Goal**: Work as a team using agile methodologies to create an Android application
- **Project Time**: 5 days
- **[Detailed Spec File](../projects/project-03/readme.md)**

##### Project 4

Students will get to call the shots and come up with their own idea, choosing tools that are appropriate for what they're looking to build.

For this project, students will be working with a team and using product development strategies to come up with a project proposal that will be reviewed with the instructional team; this it to make sure the team's proposal is something that can be accomplish in the time left in the course while also making sure it's something that will challenge students.

- **Goal**: Do user research and use product development methods to pitch an idea that will turn into a working Android app
- **Project Time**: 5 days
