### Holidays

Does the holiday schedule mean that your class is going to be behind schedule? Not to worry. Here are some tips that can help ensure that you cover all the material provided:

- Assign some of the labs and exercises as homework.
- Get started on a project during class so that students can complete the it over the holidays
- Scaffold the capstone project earlier on that even if you miss a week of course because of the break, you can still cover the rest of the material
- And lastly, make sure you're on schedule and not behind. The earlier you keep the better to make sure you're on track to getting through all the material before the class ends.

*Reminder: Immersive courses get days get added to the course to take into account for holidays, so don't worry about having to restructure the course or tag on extra days!*
