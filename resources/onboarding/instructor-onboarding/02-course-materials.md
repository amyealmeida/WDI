# Course Materials in X Course

General Assembly provides all instructors with in-class exercises, homeworks, pre-course materials, and documented instructions on how to run their course.  In this file, we'll describe the materials we provide and supplemental materials we recommend local instructional teams build on their own.

## What Does GA Provide?


#### 1. A Baseline Scope and Sequence

We highly recommend making a copy of our baseline course scope and sequence represented on [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/wUypxxc8/iosi-curriculum) and use your copy of this board to plan out your course. Take a look.  If you cannot access this board, please email (jay@) or Slack (@jaynappy) Jay Nappy.

#### 2. Daily, Weekly Supplies

We've [supplied a folder](..) for each week of the course - this folder includes a weekly schedule found in a readme.md file.

</p>


In these weekly folders, we also have folders with instructor materials, with various materials, for each in-class [lab](#in-class-lab-materials) and [homework assignments](#hw-assignments).  

Guidance on how to run recurring class activities, like presentations and reflection periods - and how to facilitate labs - are also provided in the [recurring materials](../recurring-materials) folder.

#### In-Class Lesson Materials

As mentioned, each lesson exists in it's own folder.  We've provided the following for each lesson:

|Materials | Description
|----|---------|
| __readme.md__| This is our lesson plan that contains the lesson learning objectives, talking points, and in-class exercises; be sure to read through the lesson readme _thoroughly_ and adapt portions of the lesson - introductions, demo, guided practice, independent practice - to best fit your teaching style and subject matter knowledge. |
| __Slides__| These are #{INSERT FORMAT} with slide content.  Be sure to customize each deck before sharing with students - you will learn more about this during later ITC modules.|
| __Starter Code Folder__| This is a folder with all the starter code students need for the lesson. You should share this folder with students before every lesson. Make the necessary changes if you are using different code.|
| __Solution Code Folder__| This is a folder with all solutions to in-class exercises. Share individual solution files as needed. Students should be provided with code solutions after exercises to have a reference. |
| __Assets__| This folder contains screenshots, images, diagrams, and worksheets. |

There is no such thing as a perfect lesson - be sure to put your own personal touch in the form of discussion questions, bonus activities, and anything you feel will create a better learning experience!

**Note:** You should not, however, modify the learning objectives.


###### In-Class Lab Materials

As mentioned, each lab exists in it's own folder.  We've provided the following for each lesson:


|Materials | Description
|----|---------|---------------|
| __readme.md__| This readme contains the lab description that includes the assignment prompt that provides students with context, lab requirements, what the deliverable(s) should look like, and any additional resources to help students complete the assignment. |
| __Starter Code Folder__| This is a folder with all the starter code students need for that lab. You should share this folder with students before every lab. Make the necessary changes if you are using different code.|
| __Solution Code Folder__| This is a folder with all solutions to code alongs and exercises. Share individual solution files as needed. Student should be provided with code demo solutions before lab time to use as a reference.|
| __Assets__| This is a folder with style assets and pictures necessary for the lab.|
| __Deliverables__| Typically these are screenshots of what the final deliverable of the lab should look like to help students get an idea of what they'll be building.|
| *__Rubric__|  A document that articulates the expectations for an assignment. Use this document to communicate expectations for an assignment and evaluate student performance on each of the lab requirements, on a scale from "Incomplete", "Does Not Meet Expectations", and "Meets Expectations".|

###### Recurring Weekly Materials

We provide documentation with suggestions how to conduct recurring sessions that occur repeatedly throughout the course:

- [Instructor Choice Sessions](../04-schedule-and-supplies/recurring-materials/instructor choice)
- [Morning Exercises](../04-schedule-and-supplies/recurring-materials/morning-exercise-review)
- [Administering Surveys](../04-schedule-and-supplies/recurring-materials/nps-survey)
- [Outcomes Sessions](../04-schedule-and-supplies/recurring-materials/instructor choice/outcomes)
- [Project Presentations](../04-schedule-and-supplies/recurring-materials/instructor choice/project-presentation)
- [Project Workshops](../04-schedule-and-supplies/recurring-materials/instructor choice/project-workshop)
- [Stand](../04-schedule-and-supplies/recurring-materials/instructor choice/stand)
- [Whiteboarding 1:1s](../04-schedule-and-supplies/recurring-materials/instructor choice/whiteboarding-one-on-one)

**Note**: We do not provide strict content that needs to be taught or reviewed for any of these sessions.


#### 3. Swift Reading Guide

[This](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/iosi-precourse-onboarding/blob/master/03-resources/swift-programming-guide.md#week1) reading guide provides students with guiding questions and resources for the first three weeks of material.

We recommended using this guide as a supplement to course activities. Feel free to assign particular topics to the class, ask the whole class to do these readings, or hand pick readings for individual students if you see they are struggling.

## What Is Not Provided?

To allow for instructor creativity and flexibility, we don't provide materials for every hour of every class, though we do our best to pull in [materials contributed by instructors](../instructor-contributions) from various local campuses.  

The weekly readmes will link out to these contributions from various local markets, for homework assignments, exercises, bonus activites, and optional lesson/labs.  We strongly encourage you adapt what others have created and/or build your own supplemental materials that are not provided by GA.  

Here's a list of of what is not provided by HQ for this course:

- **Lesson plans/slides** - While other courses may have lesson plans/slides, iOSI does not; we're providing the instructional team with robust in-class lab assignments, homeworks, a reading guide, and detailed learning objectives to empower them to plan their own lessons; for guidance on lesson plan format and structure, please check out our [lesson plan template](~/templates/lessons) and work with your producer and/or instructional coach
- **iOS content for the 9-10am block (morning exercise)** - We provide documentation with suggestions on how to use this time, but we leave these time blocks to be used at the instructor's discretion for most days in all of our immersive tech courses
- **Review sessions outlines/materials** - Each week, there is a given amount of time dedicated to review; as described use these to take a second pass at teaching a particular topic or even as a more structured lab to get students more practice with skills or concepts from the week; again, we provide documentation with suggestions on how to facilitate but local markets are responsible for preparing detailed review sessions
- **Instructor choice** - Also, there are sessions marked as "Instructor Choice"; use these sessions to teach about topics you **love**, exciting new technologies or tools, or even as an additional review session, if needed; again, we provide documentation with suggestions on how to facilitate this session but local markets are responsible for preparing detailed review sessions
- **Outcomes sessions** - These sessions will be facilitated by your local outcomes team. You __do not__ have to create content for these sessions.
